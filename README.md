### Annadann- Because someone is hungry
There are so many immigrants who have lost their earnings in this pandemic. They have no food.<br>
Also, there are people who are willing to help and send food for the needy but they don't know how to do it.<br>
This is a [web application](https://annadanngo.herokuapp.com/) which will be a medium between people who works towards feeding underprivileged people and people like us who want to help.<br>
